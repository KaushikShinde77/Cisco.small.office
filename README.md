# Cisco.small.office

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and simulate a functional and secure small office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes subnetting to efficiently manage IP addressing, VLANs to segment departments for improved security and traffic management, and trunking protocols to enable communication between VLANs. Wireless access is provided for laptops, tablets, and printers to ensure flexible connectivity across the office environment. DHCP is implemented to automate IP assignment, with DNS configured solely to support DHCP settings, not for active domain resolution. This project demonstrates essential networking concepts such as structured topology design, inter-VLAN routing, wireless integration, and service configuration, aimed at creating a reliable and scalable office network.

### Skills Learned 

-Designed a network topology using subnetting and VLANs for departmental separation.
-Configured routers, switches, PCs, laptops, printers, and wireless devices.
-Implemented DHCP for automatic IP address assignment.
-Created VLANs and configured trunk ports for inter-VLAN communication.
-Established wireless connectivity for various devices with security settings.
-Tested and troubleshooted the network using Cisco Packet Tracer simulation tools.

### Steps

We start by putting together all the required devices, i.e. the router, switch, pc's,etc and making basic cable connections.
